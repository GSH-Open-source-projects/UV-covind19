[**Starting, Building a DIY UV Sterilization Cabinet to Fight Covid-19 as open-source project**](https://medium.com/@gsh.med.co/starting-building-a-diy-uv-sterilization-cabinet-to-fight-covid-19-as-open-source-project-b06bb2e9cdbe)

I have seen some needs to sterilization in this situation ( Covid-19 !!) , so google these words and see some result to help doing yourself, so like to use that technology to make something like [this][1]:

[![enter image description here][2]][2]

There is one **DIY instruction** to make this robot [here][3], but don't have some information like robot parts, standard consideration and …

So tried to work on building one sterilization device by UV Light as opensource project.

for this Goal i have made one [GitHub repository](https://github.com/GSH-Open-source-projects/UV-covind19) which connected to one group teams which selected with consulting by some others like this question.

There are some question which is need to answered are like:

**1-** which one UV type is proper to using? which asked here as Simple question that needs to modified during the time by the answers and comments at the SE site.

**2-** how much power and time could be proper to sterilization one aria ( For example for 1 meter distance asked [here][4])?

**3-** which standards need to be consider for security and proper sterilization the surfaces, Some partly [here][5]:

**4-** Sensors for detecting proper sterilization, via different noise conditions!! (like [this][7])

**5-** Movement robot designing (like [this][8] or [this][9]), which must one of important part of this project that have many opensource project for help.

**6-** Team working challenges and …

**Hope to use your comments for improving this post.**

***Thanks for your consideration.***
